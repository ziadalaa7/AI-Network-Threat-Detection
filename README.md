# AI Network Threat Detection

This project is a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using the **CIC-IDS-2017 dataset**.  
It leverages **machine learning** to detect various types of network attacks, helping to secure networks efficiently.

## Features
- Detects multiple types of network intrusions
- Preprocessing and feature engineering for CIC-IDS-2017
- Machine learning-based classification models
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Dataset
- [CIC-IDS-2017](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ziadalaa7/AI-Network-Threat-Detection.git
