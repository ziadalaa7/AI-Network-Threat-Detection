# ðŸ”’ AI-Powered Network Threat Detection

Cyberattacks are growing more sophisticated every day, and traditional security tools often struggle to keep up.  
This project introduces an **AI-powered system** that monitors network traffic in real time and automatically identifies suspicious activities such as:

- Hacking attempts  
- Data theft  
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks  

The system **continuously learns** from new threats, making it more adaptive and reliable than traditional methods.
